This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's like an about page, but for what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## Currently working on

- Building this personal website with Astro and Tailwind
- Learning SwiftUI and shipping my first iOS app
- Creating fitness content and documenting my journey
- Cultivating a consistent writing practice

## Reading

- *Atomic Habits* by James Clear — re-reading for the third time
- *The Creative Act* by Rick Rubin — beautiful thoughts on creativity

## Thinking about

The intersection of tools and thought. How the software we use shapes the way we think. Why some tools feel like extensions of ourselves while others create friction.

Also thinking about building in public — the courage it takes to share unfinished work, and how feedback loops accelerate learning.

## Location

📍 Based in [Your City], exploring the local coffee shops and parks.
