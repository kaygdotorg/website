## Currently working on

- Planning my personal website redesign
- Learning SwiftUI basics through tutorials
- Starting to document my fitness journey
- Reading more consistently

## Reading

- *Show Your Work* by Austin Kleon — inspiring thoughts on sharing creative work
- *The Creative Act* by Rick Rubin — just started, loving it so far

## Thinking about

What it means to build in public. The vulnerability of sharing unfinished work, and whether the benefits outweigh the discomfort.

## Location

📍 Still based in [Your City], enjoying the autumn weather.
