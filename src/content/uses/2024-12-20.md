A living document of the tools, apps, and gear I rely on.

## Hardware

**MacBook Pro** — My daily driver for development and everything else. The M-series chips changed everything.

**iPhone** — Always in my pocket. Main camera for quick shots.

**iPad** — For reading, sketching ideas, and the occasional Procreate session.

**AirPods Pro** — Essential for focus. The noise cancellation is a productivity multiplier.

## Development

**Cursor** — AI-powered code editor that's become indispensable. The Claude integration is excellent.

**Warp** — Modern terminal with AI features. Makes the command line feel contemporary.

**Xcode** — For SwiftUI development. Still learning, but enjoying the journey.

**GitHub** — Where all my code lives. Also use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Productivity

**Apple Notes** — Quick capture and daily notes. Spotlight search makes everything findable.

**Things 3** — Task management that stays out of my way. The design is beautiful.

**Raycast** — Launcher, clipboard manager, snippets, and more. Replaced Alfred.

**Arc** — Browser that finally makes sense. Spaces and profiles are game-changers.

## Photography

**[Your Camera]** — Main camera for serious work.

**[Your Favorite Lens]** — Goes on the camera 80% of the time.

**Lightroom** — Photo editing and organization. Classic version, not the cloud one.
