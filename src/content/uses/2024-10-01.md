My setup as of early October 2024.

## Hardware

**MacBook Pro M2** — Still going strong after a year.

**iPhone 15 Pro** — Upgraded recently, loving the camera improvements.

**iPad Air** — For reading and light sketching.

## Development

**VS Code** — My main editor, though I've been eyeing Cursor.

**iTerm2** — Reliable terminal, considering trying Warp.

**Xcode** — Just starting to explore SwiftUI.

## Productivity

**Apple Notes** — Simple and effective.

**Todoist** — Task management, though thinking about switching.

**Alfred** — Launcher and automation.

**Safari** — Default browser, but hearing good things about Arc.

## Photography

Still using my iPhone as the main camera. Considering getting a dedicated camera.
