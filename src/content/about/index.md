Hey, I'm **K Gopal Krishna** — a DevOps engineer, systems enthusiast, and occasional writer based in India.

## What I Do

I work with infrastructure at scale — Kubernetes, Ceph, Proxmox, and all the tooling that makes distributed systems work. I enjoy solving complex problems and sharing those solutions through my blog and talks.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not debugging cluster issues, you'll find me:
- 📷 Taking photos (check out my [photography](/photography) page)
- 🎧 Listening to music and podcasts
- 📚 Reading about technology and philosophy
- 🏋️ Working out

## This Website

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed on my homelab. The content is written in Obsidian and synced to the site automatically.

Feel free to explore my [blog](/blog), read my [notes](/notes), or see what I'm working on [now](/now).
