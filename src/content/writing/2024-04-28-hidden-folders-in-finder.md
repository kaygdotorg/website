## ❓ What?

Hidden folders are disabled by default on MacOS, which means it won't see any files and folders starting a `.` (period/dot).

## ❔ Why?

Sometimes when I want to open a new folder from VSCode, I am at a loss on how to proceed with opening a config file which typically resides in `~/.config`.

## 🎤 How?

Press `CMD + SHIFT + .`

Of course, this can also be toggled globally with a `defaults` command, like when enabling key spam.
