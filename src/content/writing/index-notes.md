## Index Notes

This is a section of my Zettelkasten that is dedicated to grouping information ([Permanent Notes](<./permanent-notes.md>)) together and classifying / categorising them into their subsections if possible. These notes will be a superset and/or contain a map of content for a given topic / project / idea.

Tags for notes of this folder include #project #reference and their subtags. Since some topics could both be a project and a reference (like [ceph](<./ceph.md>), which is something I write about in the process of continually learning through work and/or experimentation but it is also for my own reference should I forget), I feel like it's important to define how I view them:

## Project

- Something that has a due date, that is, it has state changes: backlog, to-do, finished *OR*
- Something that involves priorities and can be weighed against in a Kanban board. For example, learning ceph over learning kubernetes would net me a greater benefit sooner since the former relates to my present career while the latter is mostly for homelabbing *AND*
- Something that has bits and pieces added to it over the course of time

## Reference

- An initiative with no due dates *OR*
- A piece of literature or media that does not involve a priority *AND*
- Adding information to it has little to no urgency and can be done so whenever desired or at random

So, learning prospects will always be [projects](<#Project>), simply because I am at a point of time in my life where shit needs to be prioritised. Self-improvement topics will always be [references](<#Reference>) since they do not hold a period of definite start or definite end. 

Can projects be references and vice versa? Truth be told, I don't know yet. I'll figure it out as this Zettelkasten grows. If all of this seems confusing, here's [a cover of one of everybody's favourite songs](https://youtu.be/M-i7QwRETf0) to enjoy.
