title: Comments!
---
This blog now has comments! Powered by [Remark42](https://remark42.com). If you can afford to, please buy the developer a coffee by [sponsoring them on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/umputun).

This works because of [Kirby's comments plugin](https://discord.com/channels/927628110009098281/1150498860666466354/1199113683276673064) for Quartz. The entire website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages and the comments element is requested from [Remark42 hosted on my server](https://remark42.kayg.org). So if ever in the future, my server is non-functional for any reason, the website still works, just the comments won't. [This decoupling](<./move-wordpress-quartz.md>) has greatly helped me with dissociating writing content from infrastructure as with Wordpress (what I used before), I would spend more time with administrative tasks (making the website go 2 Fast 2 Furious or making it look prettier or both) than actually publish more content. 

RIght now, the comments work by signup via Email, Github or Google. I am working on adding Apple and Telegram integrations too. [I really wish Remark42 had Authentik integration](https://github.com/umputun/remark42/issues/1738) though as that's one of my next projects for my infrastructure. 

So, yeah, let me know what you think! Adios, and have a great week ahead! 😊
