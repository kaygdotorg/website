## ❓ What?

- mAh is very inaccurate because it doesn't take voltage into account
	- a 5V battery with 50 Wh will have: `(50 Wh * 1000 / 5) = 10000` mAh capacity
	- a 10V battery with 50 Wh will have `(50 Wh * 1000 / 10) = 5000` mAh capacity
- mAh converts to Wh by multiplying with voltage as: `(mAh / 1000) * V`
- A higher voltage can lead to higher consumption of current, provided resistance stays the same. The relation is: `P = V * I` and `I = V / R`.
