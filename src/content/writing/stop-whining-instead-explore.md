title: Stop Whining, Instead Explore
---
It's in trend, especially as you browse X, to come across statements like, "How do people use software A? It doesn't even let you do B. It literally gives me a migraine everyday to do C," and a community notes entry that gets appended as more and more people lay eyes on the post that goes, "ackshually..."

Which is fine. Not everybody knows everything, right? I still discover new features about apps that I have been using for a year or more. But that does not mean I have to constantly whine before I have explored something. A common example I hear is, "How do you use Windows? Isn't it full of ads and bloatware?" and then they go about switching to Linux and find that their software doesn't really work on it, or things don't pan out the way they expect them to. So they switch again until the context fits their vision or more realistically, stop caring and use what is comfortable - Windows, with ads. But the context is more powerful than you think, and [it's smarter than you](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/unfolding). 

So, I find it very helpful to let things marinate. Come across a new tool that is the solution to all your problems? Use the 14 day free trial and take until the 14th day to make a commitment; explore, experiment, use, tinker, fuck with it. It certainly won't turn out exactly as great as you initially thought it was, but by giving yourself time with it, you allow a sense of familiarity to emerge and a sense of commitment to follow. Because the last 14 days have been about, in splashes or larger fragments, intertwining your existing flow with a new tool, it's less likely that switching to another app is the solution. Rather, working around the bits that annoy you, bending things, seeing through the abstractions and     [owning your workflow](https://youtu.be/m5MDv9qwhU8) would net you a peace of mind sooner than restarting the cycle will.
