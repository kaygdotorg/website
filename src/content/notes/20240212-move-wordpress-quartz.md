title: Moving from Wordpress to Quartz
---
## ❔ Why do it?

Wordpress is a fantastic CMS, no doubt, something which I have relied on since my early days of self-hosting in 2019. However, the problem wasn't related to software; it was more mental. The more I interacted with Wordpress, the more I wanted to change things around. Maybe the search button should be bigger, maybe there's a better colour scheme that fits my tempo, maybe I can speed up my website by yet another few milliseconds, maybe comment boxes having a white background on a dark theme was too contrasty, maybe... you get the point! Every time I would muster up the willpower to write something, a design element or an infrastructure element would seem more appealing in the moment. It was a path of optimisation beyond reason. 

Therefore, to restrict myself, and to make writing easier, I decided, "why not make the place I already write, Obsidian, or at least a part of it, my public website?"

## 🎤 How did you do it?

I still haven't! However, these are the indicators of progress made until now.

- [changing-wordpress-url](<./20240212-changing-wordpress-url.md>)
- [comments](<./20240422-comments.md>)

Things yet to be done are being tracked in my personal task manager, TickTick, as Obsidian task reminders are so so. Once finished, they will appear as a note on this page.
